# Project Brief: Apollo

**Project Name:** Apollo
**Date:** 2025-12-04
**Competition:** Microsoft Imagine Cup 2025 - Education Theme
**Competition Deadline:** December 28, 2025 (24 days)
**Team Size:** 3 members
**Brief Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

We're building an AI-powered goal achievement platform that acts as a Socratic mentor rather than a solution provider. The platform helps learners pursue self-chosen goals through structured guidance (based on the Harada Method), peer community support, and adaptive scaffolding that preserves the learning process while removing friction.

**Primary Problem:** AI education tools either give direct answers (fast but no learning) or assign work without support (slow and demotivating). Traditional education forces curriculum on students, leading to disengagement.

**Target Market:** Individual learners (students, professionals, lifelong learners) pursuing self-chosen goals - B2C model.

**Key Value Proposition:** We help people reach their goals by matching them with others, mentors, and simple next steps — faster and more useful than searching on your own. Unlike ChatGPT which gives answers, we guide you to find answers yourself. Unlike traditional education which forces topics, we support YOUR chosen goals.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

AI is reshaping education, but current approaches create three critical problems:

1. **Loss of Human Interaction & Mentorship**
   - AI tools like ChatGPT provide instant answers, removing the struggle that creates deep learning
   - Students copy AI solutions without understanding, failing to develop problem-solving skills
   - No emotional support or motivation when learners face genuine difficulty

2. **Lack of Intrinsic Motivation**
   - Traditional education forces curriculum on students (one-size-fits-all)
   - Learners disengage when topics don't align with personal interests or goals
   - High dropout rates in online learning (70-90% for MOOCs)

3. **Friction vs. Challenge Confusion**
   - Productive struggle (challenge) builds skills and resilience
   - Unproductive friction (unclear steps, missing resources, isolation) causes abandonment
   - Current systems don't distinguish between the two

### Impact of the Problem

**For Learners:**
- Knowledge without understanding (copy-paste from AI)
- Goals abandoned due to overwhelm or lack of support
- Competing dopamine sources (social media) win attention battle
- Loss of metacognitive skills (learning how to learn)

**For Education:**
- AI tools undermine learning outcomes while claiming to enhance them
- Teachers struggle to scale personalized mentorship
- Assessment becomes impossible when AI does the work

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini:** Provide direct answers → No learning process, no accountability
- **Duolingo/Khan Academy:** Fixed curriculum → Not personalized to user's actual goals
- **Coursera/Udemy:** Lecture-based → High dropout, no peer support, passive learning
- **Notion/Productivity Apps:** Organization tools → Don't provide guidance or motivation
- **Traditional Education:** Forced curriculum → Disengagement, lack of autonomy

### Urgency and Importance

The Microsoft Imagine Cup theme recognizes this crisis: "AI is reshaping the way institutions support learners and teachers alike." We're at a critical inflection point:
- AI capabilities are advancing rapidly (making "just give me the answer" easier)
- Educational institutions are struggling to adapt
- A generation of learners risks losing critical thinking and problem-solving skills
- The solution must preserve human growth while leveraging AI's power

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

An AI-powered platform that combines:

1. **Harada Method Structure** (Goals → Actionable Steps)
   - Users state a goal they genuinely care about
   - AI generates personalized plan: multiple goals broken into actionable steps
   - Flexible structure (not rigidly 8x8) adapts to complexity and user capability

2. **Dual AI System**
   - **Mentor AI:** Uses Socratic method - asks questions, doesn't give answers
   - **Emotional Support AI:** Detects frustration, provides encouragement, switches context when needed
   - System intelligently detects genuine struggle vs. laziness using progress history + emotion analysis

3. **Adaptive Scaffolding**
   - When users are genuinely stuck (not lazy), AI breaks action steps into 5-10 minute micro-steps
   - Preserves learning (user still does the work) while removing overwhelm
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on user progress

4. **Community Infrastructure**
   - Forums organized by goal type (e.g., "Learning Python", "Getting Fit")
   - Peer matching: Connect users working on similar action steps
   - Public celebration of completed milestones (non-gamified recognition)

5. **Engagement & Habit Formation**
   - Streak tracking (consecutive days of progress)
   - Bite-sized tasks (every step completable in 5-10 minutes)
   - Integrated note-taking/organization (build personal knowledge base)

### Key Differentiators

| Feature | Our Platform | ChatGPT/AI Tools | Traditional Education | Productivity Apps |
|---------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Answers questions** | No - asks guiding questions (Socratic) | Yes - direct answers | Sometimes | N/A |
| **User-chosen goals** | ✅ Core feature | N/A | ❌ Fixed curriculum | ✅ But no guidance |
| **Emotional support** | ✅ Dual AI system | ❌ | Limited (teacher capacity) | ❌ |
| **Peer community** | ✅ Goal-based forums | ❌ | Limited (classmates) | ❌ |
| **Adaptive difficulty** | ✅ Dynamic micro-stepping | ❌ | Limited | ❌ |
| **Preserves learning** | ✅ Forces user to do work | ❌ Does work for you | ✅ | N/A |

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

1. **Addresses Root Causes, Not Symptoms**
   - Laziness → Remove friction (instant peer help, resources), add streaks
   - Lack of interest → Self-chosen goals only
   - System failure → Reject forced curriculum model entirely

2. **Redirects AI Speed, Doesn't Sacrifice It**
   - AI generates personalized plans in seconds
   - AI instantly finds resources, matches peers, detects emotion
   - Speed applied to removing obstacles, not doing the work

3. **Competition Timing**
   - Microsoft Imagine Cup validates the problem urgency
   - LLM technology (GPT-4, Claude) makes dual AI system feasible now
   - Market ready for "AI that makes you smarter" vs. "AI that makes you lazy"

### High-Level Vision

**Short-term (6 months):** Platform where learners achieve self-chosen goals with AI mentorship + peer support, demonstrating better outcomes than solo AI tool usage.

**Long-term (2 years):** Become the default alternative to traditional education for skill acquisition - a global learning community where millions support each other's growth with AI as the scalable mentor layer.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

1. **Goal Input & AI Planning**
   - User describes goal in natural language
   - AI generates Harada-style plan (flexible number of goals and steps)
   - User can request modifications ("this step is unreachable")
   - **Rationale:** Core value proposition - structured planning that's personalized

2. **Dual AI Mentor System**
   - Mentor AI: Socratic questioning mode (refuses direct answers)
   - Emotional AI: Detects frustration, provides encouragement
   - Context switching based on progress history + emotion detection
   - **Rationale:** This IS the differentiator - without this, we're just another AI chatbot

3. **Progress Tracking & Streaks**
   - Daily check-ins ("What are you working on today?")
   - Streak counter (consecutive days active)
   - Visual progress on goals and action steps
   - **Rationale:** Habit formation critical for retention, borrowed from Duolingo success

4. **Dynamic Micro-Stepping**
   - When user is genuinely stuck, AI breaks current step into 5-10 min micro-steps
   - Temporary scaffolding that user can exit when ready
   - **Rationale:** Preserves learning while removing overwhelm - key to "adaptive" claim

5. **Basic Community Forums**
   - Goal-type based forums (auto-created as users join)
   - Post questions, share progress, get peer support
   - Simple upvote/reply functionality
   - **Rationale:** Human connection that AI can't replace - addresses "loss of human interaction" problem

6. **Simple Note-Taking**
   - Capture insights, resources, reflections per goal
   - Basic markdown support
   - **Rationale:** Metacognitive tool + builds ownership of learning journey

### Out of Scope for MVP

**GIVEN 24-DAY TIMELINE, ADDITIONAL CUTS NEEDED:**

❌ **Definitely Out:**
- Mobile apps (web-first, mobile-responsive only)
- Advanced peer matching algorithm (manual search initially)
- Public profile pages / social features beyond forums
- Integration with external tools (Notion, Google Calendar, etc.)
- Voice-based AI mentor
- Multi-language support (English only MVP)
- Payment/monetization features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Gamification (points, badges, leaderboards)
- Live group learning sessions
- Psychological intake assessment (use simplified version)
- Video/image uploads in notes
- API for third-party integrations

⚠️ **Consider Cutting for Time:**
- Forums might be too complex - could replace with simple "share your progress" feed
- Note-taking could be simplified to single text area (not full markdown)
- Emotion detection could be simplified rules-based vs. ML (if sentiment analysis adds complexity)

### MVP Success Criteria

**The MVP is successful if:**

1. **Users achieve goals:** At least 20% of users complete 1+ goals within 60 days with demonstrable learning
2. **Socratic method works:** 75%+ of Mentor AI interactions successfully guide without giving direct answers
3. **Emotional detection works:** Users report feeling supported when stuck (survey: 7+/10 average)
4. **Community engagement:** 30%+ of users participate in forums (post or reply)
5. **Retention validates need:** 25%+ 30-day retention rate
6. **Competition validation:** Judges/users confirm this solves "loss of human interaction" problem better than existing AI tools

- No PII storage beyond necessary (email, username)

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Budget:**
- Competition budget: Limited/bootstrap mode
- LLM API costs: Primary expense (estimate $0.02-0.10 per user interaction)
- Azure hosting: <$100/month initially using free tier + student credits (App Service Free/Basic tier, PostgreSQL Basic tier)
- Microsoft Imagine Cup may provide Azure credits for participants
- No paid marketing budget (organic growth, competition exposure only)

**Timeline:**
- Competition deadline: December 28, 2025 (24 days from now)
- MVP development: 18-20 days (accelerated sprint)
- Beta testing: 3-4 days before submission
- Total time to competition-ready product: 24 days (AGGRESSIVE)

**Resources:**
- Team size: 3 members
- Available time: Full sprint mode for competition (24-day crunch)
- Technical expertise: [To be specified - likely web dev, AI/ML, design split across 3 people]

**Technical:**
- LLM API rate limits (OpenAI: tier-based, Anthropic: quota-based)
- Cannot fine-tune models initially (cost prohibitive)
- Must use third-party services (can't build own LLM, hosting infrastructure)
- Real-time features limited by free-tier WebSocket constraints

### Key Assumptions

- Users will be honest about their effort (not gaming the "stuck" detection system excessively)
- Self-chosen goals lead to higher intrinsic motivation than assigned curriculum
- Socratic method works in text-based AI chat format (not just human conversation)
- Peer community will be supportive (not toxic) with basic moderation
- 16-35 age demographic comfortable with AI interaction
- English-only market sufficient for initial validation
- Users willing to struggle/think vs. getting instant answers (hypothesis to test)
- Competition judges value innovation in learning preservation over pure AI capabilities
- LLM quality (GPT-4/Claude) sufficient for nuanced Socratic questioning
- 5-10 minute micro-steps are optimal bite-size (not too small, not too large)
- Streaks are motivating for goal pursuit (transferable from language learning)
- B2C monetization possible post-competition (freemium or subscription model)

---

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **LLM Cost Explosion:** If usage exceeds projections, API costs could become unsustainable quickly
  - *Mitigation:* Strict rate limiting per user, caching common responses, quota alerts

- **Socratic AI Failure:** Mentor AI might give direct answers despite prompting (LLM jailbreak/confusion)
  - *Mitigation:* Extensive prompt engineering, testing with diverse queries, fallback to "I can't answer that directly" responses

- **Cold Start Problem:** Forums require critical mass of users to be valuable, but users won't join without active forums
  - *Mitigation:* Seed forums with team/beta testers, focus on 3-5 popular goal types initially

- **Low Engagement:** Users might sign up, get plan, then never return
  - *Mitigation:* Aggressive onboarding (complete first micro-step in session 1), email/push notifications for streaks, early beta testing to iterate

- **Competition from Free AI:** Why use our platform when ChatGPT is free and gives instant answers?
  - *Mitigation:* Clear messaging on learning outcomes ("Do you want answers or do you want to learn?"), testimonials showing goal achievement

- **Toxicity in Community:** Forums could become spam-filled or hostile without moderation
  - *Mitigation:* Basic profanity filter, report/block features, active moderation during beta, clear community guidelines

- **Emotion Detection Inaccuracy:** False positives (thinking user is stuck when they're not) or false negatives (missing genuine struggles)
  - *Mitigation:* Validate with user feedback ("Does this help?" after micro-stepping), iterate on detection algorithm, allow manual help requests

### Open Questions

- **Monetization:** How will we make money post-competition? Freemium limits? Subscription pricing? B2B licensing?
- **Scope Creep:** How do we resist adding features when competition judges might favor "more impressive" demos?
- **Goal Scope:** Do we restrict goal types (education only) or allow fitness, creative, career goals too?
- **Onboarding Length:** How much setup before users get value? (Psychological assessment vs. quick start?)
- **Privacy:** Can we use anonymized user data to improve AI prompts? GDPR implications?
- **Moderation Scale:** At what user count do we need paid moderators vs. volunteer/AI moderation?
- **Competition Judging Criteria:** What do judges weight most? Technical complexity? Social impact? Business viability?
- **Team Roles:** Who owns what? (Frontend, backend, AI prompts, design, pitch deck, video?)

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **Learning Science:** What does research say about optimal Socratic questioning in digital formats?
- **Competitor Landscape:** Who else is building similar tools? (Need formal competitive analysis)
- **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Best practices for consistent Socratic behavior, emotion detection accuracy
- **Goal-Setting Frameworks:** Deep dive into Harada Method - are there better alternatives? (OKRs, SMART goals, etc.)
- **Community Moderation:** What tools exist for automated moderation? Cost/feasibility?
- **Accessibility:** WCAG compliance requirements, screen reader support effort
- **User Research:** Interviews with 10-20 target users to validate assumptions before building
