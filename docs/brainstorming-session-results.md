## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - 20 minutes

**Description:** Explored provocative questions to challenge the core tension between AI speed and human learning growth.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **AI speed and human growth aren't opposites** - AI redirects speed toward removing friction rather than doing the work
2. **AI as mentor, not solution provider** - The role is to guide humans to work in a "humane way" with motivation
3. **Social clustering for accountability** - Group users with similar actionable tasks to help each other
4. **Public celebration over gamification** - Recognize timely task completion publicly rather than points/badges
5. **Dual AI architecture** - Main mentor AI + emotional support AI that can switch contextually based on user needs
6. **Progress visualization** - Make the learning journey tangible and visible
7. **AI removes friction, not work** - Speed applied to instantly connecting peers, finding resources, detecting motivation drops
8. **Three core friction points identified:**
   - Laziness (lack of intrinsic motivation)
   - Lack of interest (forced vs. chosen learning)
   - System failure (repetition, coercion, one-size-fits-all)
9. **Laziness redefined** - Not character flaw, but response to: too many hurdles + competing dopamine sources
10. **Psychological intake/trivia** - Assess user's genuine resolve and commitment before goal-setting begins
11. **Pre-emptive motivation** - AI strengthens resolve BEFORE the journey starts

**Insights Discovered:**
- The product isn't just competing with other AI tools - it's competing with a broken educational system
- The Harada Method's power comes from SELF-CHOSEN goals, which eliminates much of the "lack of interest" problem
- Laziness is often a friction problem, not a motivation problem - remove hurdles and engagement increases
- AI mentorship at this level competes with social media and instant gratification platforms for attention

**Notable Connections:**
- Self-chosen goals + peer support + AI mentorship = addresses all three core friction points
- Speed isn't sacrificed - it's redirected from "doing work" to "enabling better work"
- Emotional AI isn't a nice-to-have, it's essential for distinguishing laziness from genuine struggle

---

### Assumption Reversal - 15 minutes

**Description:** Challenged core assumptions about the product to discover breakthrough insights.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **AI proposes, user negotiates** - AI creates initial 8x8 Harada structure, but user can request changes for unreachable goals
   - Rationale: Reduces activation energy (first step must be easy)
   - Addresses knowledge gap (uninformed users don't know what's possible)
   - Maintains agency (collaborative negotiation, not dictation)

2. **Speed and learning both maximized** - Not a balance/trade-off, but both achieved simultaneously
   - AI generates personalized plans in seconds (speed ✅)
   - Uses speed to remove obstacles throughout journey (ongoing speed ✅)
   - Pitch reframe: "We make learning faster by using AI to remove every obstacle except the actual learning"

3. **AI refuses direct answers, uses Socratic method** - When user asks "how do I do this task?"
   - AI responds with guiding questions, not answers
   - Helps user figure it out themselves
   - Critical teaching behavior pattern

4. **Detection system for genuine struggle vs. laziness** - Combination of:
   - **Progress History Analysis:** Track completion rate, time invested, engagement patterns
   - **Emotional AI Check-In:** Detect frustration levels, anxiety, emotional trajectory
   - **Combined logic:** Both systems must agree before switching from questioning to help mode

5. **Help mode = Micro-stepping** - When user is genuinely stuck (not lazy):
   - Break the current action step into 3-5 micro-steps (5-10 min each)
   - Preserves learning (they still do the work)
   - Removes overwhelm (smaller chunks)
   - Builds momentum (quick wins)

6. **Flexible structure, fixed layers** - Keep 2-layer architecture (Goals → Action Steps) but:
   - Number of goals can vary (not locked to 8)
   - Number of steps per goal adapts to complexity (not locked to 8)
   - Structure adapts to reality while staying simple

7. **B2C model (direct to learners)** - Target individual students/learners, not institutions
   - Faster adoption (no bureaucracy)
   - True personalization (not constrained by curriculum)
   - Aligns with self-chosen goals philosophy
   - Global reach
   - Competition-timeline friendly

**Insights Discovered:**
- The AI's personality/interaction model IS the product differentiator
- Asking good questions is harder than giving answers - this is the AI's core competency
- The product preserves human agency at every decision point (negotiate goals, request help, choose peers)
- B2C positioning means competing with YouTube/TikTok for attention, not competing with schools

**Notable Connections:**
- Socratic method + emotion detection = AI that knows when to push and when to support
- Micro-stepping isn't failure, it's adaptive scaffolding that meets users where they are
- Fixed structure with flexible numbers = predictability + personalization

### Analogical Thinking - 15 minutes

**Description:** Drew inspiration from successful products in other domains to identify transferable patterns.

**Ideas Generated:**

**From Duolingo (Language Learning):**

1. **Bite-sized actionable steps (5-10 min max)**
   - Each action step completable in one short session
   - Reduces "I don't have time" excuse
   - Low activation energy
   - AI dynamically breaks tasks into 5-10 min micro-steps when users struggle

2. **Streak system (daily consistency)**
   - Track consecutive days of goal work
   - Creates habit formation
   - Taps into loss aversion psychology
   - Emotional AI encourages when streak is at risk

**From Notion (Flexible Organization):**

3. **Note-taking and organization system**
   - Users document their learning journey
   - Capture insights, resources, reflections
   - Organize materials related to goals
   - Build personal knowledge base
   - Makes progress tangible and reviewable
   - Creates ownership of the learning process

**From Reddit (Community Power):**

4. **Community forums for help**
   - Users ask questions when stuck
   - Peer-to-peer support (not just AI-dependent)
   - Organized by goal type or topic area
   - Creates "we're in this together" feeling
   - Reduces pressure on AI to have all answers

**Insights Discovered:**
- Habit formation (streaks) + low friction (bite-sized) = powerful behavior change combination
- Note-taking isn't just a feature - it's a metacognitive tool that reinforces learning
- Community support scales infinitely and provides human connection AI cannot replicate
- The best products borrow patterns from multiple domains

**Notable Connections:**
- Duolingo solved the "daily habit" problem - critical for goal pursuit
- Notion's flexibility lets users build THEIR system, not conform to someone else's
- Reddit's anonymous-but-persistent model enables vulnerable sharing about struggles
- All three products create daily engagement loops

### SCAMPER Method - 5 minutes (Partial)

**Description:** Systematic transformation technique (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse). Session abbreviated by user request.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Substitute: No changes** - Core structure validated as sound
2. **Combine: Noted but not explored** - Acknowledged integration opportunities (calendar sync, real-world projects, automatic peer matching)

**Insights Discovered:**
- Sometimes the best innovation is NOT changing what's already working
- User confidence in core concept increased through exploration process

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **The paradox was false:** Speed vs. learning isn't a trade-off. Speed gets redirected from "doing work" to "removing friction." Both can be maximized simultaneously.

- **Socratic teaching is the product:** The AI's refusal to give direct answers and insistence on guiding users to figure things out IS the core innovation. Without this, it's just another AI assistant.

- **Emotions are first-class data:** Detecting frustration, anxiety, and motivation isn't a nice-to-have feature - it's essential infrastructure for adaptive scaffolding to work.

- **Self-chosen goals change everything:** Most educational AI assumes externally-assigned learning objectives. By focusing on user-chosen goals, the motivation problem largely disappears.

- **Community isn't optional:** Peer support provides the human connection that AI cannot replicate. Forums + peer matching = essential infrastructure, not secondary features.

- **The competition is social media:** B2C positioning means competing with TikTok, YouTube, Instagram for users' time and attention. The product must be engaging enough to win that battle.

- **Laziness is a symptom, not a cause:** What appears as laziness is usually: too many hurdles (friction), competing dopamine sources (entertainment), or lack of genuine interest (forced goals). The product addresses all three root causes.

- **Micro-stepping preserves dignity:** Breaking tasks into smaller pieces when users struggle isn't "dumbing it down" - it's meeting them where they are while maintaining the expectation that they do the work.

- **Accessibility:** Multi-language support? Visual/hearing impairments? Mobile-first vs. desktop?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- **Five Whys:** Dig deeper into the monetization question and user acquisition challenge
- **Morphological Analysis:** Map out all possible feature combinations for MVP vs. V2 vs. V3
- **Role Playing:** Brainstorm from different stakeholder perspectives (student user, teacher observer, competition judge, investor)
- **Resource Constraints:** "How would you build this with only $500 and 6 weeks?" - forces prioritization

### Questions That Emerged

- What age range are we targeting? (High school? College? Professional learners? All?)
- How do we measure success for the competition? (User engagement? Learning outcomes? Testimonials?)
- Should we build mobile app or web app first?
- How do we handle goals that aren't "educational" in traditional sense? (Fitness goals? Creative goals? Career goals?)
- What happens when users abandon goals? Does AI try to re-engage or let them quit gracefully?
- How do we validate that learning is actually happening (vs. just task completion)?
- Privacy concerns: What data do we collect? How do we protect it? GDPR compliance?

### Next Session Planning

**Suggested topics:**
- Competitive analysis and differentiation strategy
